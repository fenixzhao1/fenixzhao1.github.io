I empirically assess the salience theory across various asset market formats in the context of the growth-value puzzle. The salience theory predicts that investors tend to overprice assets with salient positive returns and underprice those with salient negative returns. In individual investment tasks, laboratory subjects trade with an automated investor rather than human counterparts. The salience theory aligns with observed behavior, where assets with salient positive returns see increased asking prices, and those with salient negative returns have reduced bid prices. However, market dynamics and feedback in call markets drive bids and asks closer to rational expectations. In the context of continuous double auction markets, subjects even exhibit aversion to relatively high probabilities of losses, a phenomenon at odds with the predictions of the salience theory.
